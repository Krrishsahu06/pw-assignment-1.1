    <h4>Emment in html</h4>
    <p>Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full
        pieces of code. By using Emmet, email designers type less, saving both keystrokes and time when building a
        campaign. Also, relying on Emmetâ€™s autocompletion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust
        emails.</p>
